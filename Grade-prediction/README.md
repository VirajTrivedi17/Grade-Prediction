### Project Overview

 The Ministry of Education for Portugal wants to chase an ambitious target of 100% completion rate for students in the country. They want to periodically check the performance of students at different schools under its jurisdiction. They are interested in studying the outcomes of students at different schools and want to intervene and take preventive action at the right juncture if a student shows indicators of poor performance. They have collected various academic and personal characteristics of the students as well as final grades. The task is to predict the final grade from the student information so that the ministry officials can identify at-risk students. To solve this problem, they have approached you to help solve their problem.
